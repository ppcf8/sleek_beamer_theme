SLEEK Beamer Theme
=================
The [Beamer Class](http://www.tex.ac.uk/CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/beamer/doc/beameruserguide.pdf) for LaTeX is used to create presentations that are to be shown with a projector
	
The theme presented here was adapted from [HSRM theme by Benjamin Weiss](https://github.com/benjamin-weiss/hsrmbeamertheme). The demo presentations pdf are in fact a tutorial to create presentations with this theme.
